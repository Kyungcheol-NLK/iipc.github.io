    <div class="section"><h2>Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a></h2>
        <p><b>wayback</b> is an open source java implementation of the
        <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">The Internet Archive
        Wayback Machine</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The current production version of the Wayback Machine is implemented in
        perl, and lacks in maintainability and extensibility. Also, the code is
        not open source. Primary motivation for the new version is to address 
        these three issues, enabling public distribution of the application, and
        easy experimentation with new features and access technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
        The current Java version of the Wayback Machine supports three access,
        or Replay modes of operation: &quot;Archival Url&quot; mode &quot;Proxy&quot; mode, and
        &quot;Domain Prefix&quot; mode.
        </p>
        <p>
        Archival URL mode provides a user experience very close to the current
        production Wayback Machine. All query and replay access requests can be 
        expressed as URLs. In Archival Url replay mode, archived content is 
        modified as it is returned to users, attempting to make links and
        embedded content refer back to the Wayback Machine by rewriting them as
        Archival URLs.
        </p>
        <p>
        Proxy URL mode allows replaying of archived documents within a client
        browser by configuring the browser to proxy all HTTP requests through
        the Wayback Machine. This has the strong advantage that no Javascript 
        or server side page markup is required to coerce the client browser to 
        request additional URLs and embedded content from the Wayback Machine
        -- content just works as-is. When used with the Firefox plugin
        extension, available
        <a class="externalLink" href="http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/waxtoolbar/">
          here
        </a>, client browsers can navigate between versions of the current 
        document, and the Wayback Machine server will attempt to display images
        from the same time period as pages being viewed. The Proxy URL mode 
        requires special configuration of the client web browser to access the 
        Wayback Service. This browser configuration is not complex, but it 
        means that content cannot be accessed as a global URL.
        </p>
        <p>
          DomainPrefix mode is similar to ArchivalUrl mode, but uses a wildcard
          DNS scheme to rewrite URLs, allowing all URL substitution to occur on
          the server. This mode is considered experimental.
        </p>
        <p>See the <a href="administrator_manual.html">Administrator Manual</a>
        to learn more about access modes.
        </p>
        <p>
        The current Java version can operate in several deployment modes, 
        ranging from a stand alone application on a single host holding all
        archived documents and indexes, up to a highly distributed system where
        indexes and archived content is spread across hundreds of machines.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the local, standalone mode, this software includes the capability to
        scan for new archived content in a specified location, and to
        automatically index and serve the new content as it appears. Directing
        the Wayback to look for W/ARC files in the directory where an instance of
        the Heritrix web crawler is writing W/ARC output should provide the 
        capability to browse content archived by Heritrix as it is crawled.

          <p>
            The 1.6.0 release is now available, with improved
            server-side rewriting of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SWF content.
            This version includes other new features and bug fixes, which are
            detailed on the <a href="release_notes.html">release notes</a> page.
            Upgrading to this version will require changes to Wayback Spring XML
            configuration.

            Release 1.4.2 fixes several problems discovered in the 1.4.1 
            release. Please see the <a href="release_notes.html">release notes</a> for

            Release 1.4.1 fixes several problems discovered in the 1.4.0 
            release, and most notably disables by default the AnchorDate and
            AnchorWindow features which generated some confusion. Please

          <p>
            Release 1.4.0 has several new features, as well as several 
            bug-fixes. This version includes substantial code changes and
            refactoring to consolidate and expand current functionality as well
            as enable several future planned features. Notable new features
            include the ability to insert content in replayed HTML pages within
            Proxy and DomainPrefix replay modes, the ability to scan multiple
            local directories recursively for ARC/WARC files, and a feature
            within Archival URL replay mode to prevent time drift during a
            replay session.

          <p>
            Release 1.2.0 has several new features, as well as several 
            bug-fixes. Wayback now supports compressed and uncompressed 
            ARC and WARC formats. Previously there was only support for 
            compressed ARC files. This version also includes a new Archival URL
            replay mechanism, where all URL rewriting occurs on the server,
            obviating the need for client-side Javascript, and preventing
            some request leakage. This version also includes the capability to
            replace the default URL canonicalization scheme(currently there is
            still only one implementation available, but the groundwork for
            using different schemes is now in place.) This version also
            includes support for de-duplicated WARC records.

        <div class="section"><h3>New Release - 1.0.0, 10/12/2007<a name="New_Release_-_1.0.0_10122007"></a></h3>
          <p>
            Release 1.0.0 has several significant changes, most notably a
            completely new configuration mechanism using Spring IOC. This new
            configuration system introduces some deployment concepts:
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>WaybackCollections</b> define a set of documents via the
                previously existing ResourceStore and ResourceIndex 
                implementations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>AccessPoints</b> define a method by which users can access
                and interact with a WaybackCollection. A single 
                WaybackCollection may be exposed to users through several
                AccessPoints simultaneously. Each AccessPoint specifies an
                access URL, a Query interface, a Replay interface, and
                several optional access restrictions, including limiting who
                can connect to the AccessPoint, and which documents in the 
                WaybackCollection are available through the AccessPoint.   
              </li>
            </ul>
            This new configuration frameworks allows hosting of hundreds of
            individual collections within a single wayback installation, each
            with potentially multiple AccessPoints.
          
          <p>
            This version also includes a major refactoring of the Replay User
            Interface framework, simplifying extension and the creation of novel
            replay modes. Specifically, one or more external .jsp files can 
            be used to generate additional HTML content within replayed HTML 
            pages. The Timeline Replay mode has been completely replaced by one
            of these external .jsp files, which inserts the Timeline banner 
            inside replayed HTML pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            This version includes a very experimental new Replay mode, 
            <i>domain-prefix</i> replay mode, which performs all markup and
            recontextualization of replayed HTML documents on the server-side,
            eliminating the need for client-side Javascript execution. Please
            ask on the discussion list for assistance in using this Replay mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, this version has some internal improvements which should 
            reduce memory consumption, and the software is now built using 
            maven2.
