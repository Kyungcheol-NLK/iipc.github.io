      <div class="section"><h3>Overview<a name="Overview"></a></h3>
        <p>
          A ResourceIndex locates documents within a WaybackCollection through
          a single method:
          </p><div><pre>
  public SearchResults query(final WaybackRequest request)
    throws ResourceIndexNotAvailableException,
    ResourceNotInArchiveException, BadQueryException,
    AccessControlException;
          </pre></div>
          The ResourceIndex is responsible for deciding which SearchResults
          subclass, <b>CaptureSearchResults</b> or <b>UrlSearchResults</b>, is
          appropriate for the WaybackRequest argument, and for populating the
          returned SearchResults object with matching records.
        
        <p>
          When the request indicates the user wishes to find specific captures 
          of a single URL, CaptureSearchResults should be returned. When the
          request may return results for multiple URLs, for example a query
          attempting to locate all URLs beginning with a given prefix within
          the WaybackCollection, a URLSearchResults object should be
          returned.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><h3>LocalResourceIndex configuration options<a name="LocalResourceIndex_configuration_options"></a></h3>
        <p>
          This ResourceIndex implementation assumes a local database of all
          documents within the WaybackCollection. The type of database is
          specified with the <b>source</b> property.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following configuration is required for a LocalResourceIndex:
          </p><ul>
            <li><b>source</b> - a bean implementing SearchResultSource, which
                can be one of the following:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>BDBIndex</b> - a BDBJE database holding records for all
                      documents within the WaybackCollection. This 
                      implementation allows for fast incremental updates to the
                      index, and is required when using automatic indexing.
                      This implementation scales well to 10's of millions of
                      records.</li>
                  <li><b>CDXIndex</b> - a sorted flat file containing one line
                      per document within the WaybackCollection. This 
                      implementation requires that the CDX file be manually
                      maintained, but scales to very large sizes, limited
                      primarily by the size of file you can build and store.
                      CDX files can be built using the command line tool
                      <b>arc-indexer</b> or <b>warc-indexer</b>, and the
                      standard UNIX <b>sort</b> tool.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>CompositeSearchResultSource</b> - an implementation
                      allowing aggregation of multiple SearchResultSources into
                      a single logical SearchResultSource. Use of BDBIndex 
                      SearchResultSources within this class is experimental,
                      but this implementation has been used successfully in
                      production installations to serve results from several
                      CDXIndex files. For optimal search efficiency, multiple
                      index files should be merged (sort -mu) prior to
                      production use, but this implementation allows a
                      trade-off in simplified index management for a decrease
                      in search performance. A useful strategy for managing
                      large scale collections is to use several CDX files of
                      increasing size. Updates to the set of CDX files are
                      always performed against the smallest CDX file, and
                      occasionally this small file is merged with one of the
                      larger files, minimizing the amount of data that needs to
                      be read, sorted, and written back to disk to update the
                      set of CDX files.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        
        <p>
          The following configurations are optional for LocalResourceIndexes:
          </p><ul>
            <li><b>maxRecords</b> - integer maximum number of records to process
                for a single request. Useful to prevent a single request from
                using too much Disk and CPU resources.</li>
            <li><b>dedupeRecords</b> - boolean value that should be set to
                <i>true</i> when using deduplicated WARC records. This causes
                Wayback to modify search results as they are read from the
                index, so records indicating a resource was inspected but not
                saved are accessible within the Wayback. Please see the
                <a href="#Duplicate_Reduction">Duplicate Reduction</a> section
                below for more information.</li>
            <li><b>annotater</b> - experimental hook for modifying or omitting
                records as they are read from the index. For example, additional
                metadata could be associated with each record from an external
                datasource, and this extra metadata could then be exposed to
                end users through a .jsp customization.</li>
            <li><b>canonicalizer</b> - an implementation of UrlCanonicalizer.
                See the section labeled URL Canonicalization below for more
                information.</li>
            <li><b>filter</b> - an implementation of 
            	ObjectFilter&lt;CaptureSearchResult&gt; which will remove
            	records at query time from the index.</li>
                
          </ul>

        <p>
          This ResourceIndex implementation requests an external Wayback
          installation to satisfy index requests, and can be useful for
          distributed installations, as well as for experimenting with new
          Wayback configurations and installations using an existing
          ResourceIndex. For example, a development system can be configured to
          use a production index remotely, minimizing the requirements and
          setup required to test new configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual index must be stored on another Wayback installation, and
          is requested as XML through this implementation.

          This implementation, similar to the RemoteResourceIndex, accesses
          index functionality from an external NutchWAX installation. This mode
          of operation is considered experimental, and is not used within
          Internet Archive production installations for performance reasons.
          IA enables search within archived collections using NutchWax, but a
          separate CDX index is used for Wayback Query and Replay
          functionality. NutchWax is customized in these installations to
          generate links within it's internal UI that direct to the appropriate
          pages within the corresponding Wayback installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following configuration is required for a RemoteResourceIndex:
          <ul>
            <li>searchUrlBase - the URL prefix indicating the opensearch API to
                be used for queries.

          which differ only in the capitalization of the letter &quot;i&quot;. On some
          operating systems, these two URLs legitimately specify two distinct 
          documents. On Windows platforms, they refer to the same document. If
          the document on a web server is actually named &quot;Interview.html&quot;, but
          a web designer creates a web page that refers to this document using
          the lowercase &quot;interview.html&quot;, then the link will work, and they and
          the web site visitors may never notice the difference. The same 
          situation on a different operating system would probably not work
          (although some web server plugins and modules will also correct this
          problem transparently) and the web designer would probably notice and
          correct the problem. In practice, we have found that it is very rare
          for the two URLs above with different capitalization to refer to
          different documents, and they can be treated as equivalent in most
          situations.
        
        <p>
          Another example, which occurs far more often in the real world, 
          involves web servers injecting a session ID inside paths to documents
          hosted on that web server. These session IDs allow the web server to
          track individual user's states. Here are some example URLs 
          demonstrating path session ID injection:
          </p><div><pre>
            http://www.example.com/(S(4hqa0555fwsecu455xqckv45))/page1.aspx
            http://www.example.com/(S(4hqa0555fwsecu455xqckv45))/page2.aspx
            http://www.example.com/(S(a63098d96360a63098d96360))/page3.aspx
          </pre></div>
          In these examples, the first two URLs are using one session ID, and 
          the third uses a different session ID. If <b>page3.aspx</b> refers to 
          <b>page1.aspx</b> using an anchor like this:
          <div><pre>
            &lt;a href=&quot;page1.aspx&quot;&gt;page1&lt;/a&gt;
          </pre></div>
          and a user visiting <b>page3.aspx</b> clicks the link to page1, then
          the wayback will recieve a request for the URL:
          <div><pre>
            http://www.example.com/(S(a63098d96360a63098d96360))/page1.aspx
          </pre></div>
          If page1.aspx was captured using the different session ID, then the
          wayback will be unable to locate this document in the index, even
          though it was captured.
        
        <p>
          This session ID problem can be mitigated by <i>canonicalizing</i> the
          URLs as they are placed in the index, so the index would contain the
          following URLs, instead of the original form, which the crawler 
          captured:
          </p><div><pre>
            http://www.example.com/page1.aspx
            http://www.example.com/page2.aspx
            http://www.example.com/page3.aspx
          </pre></div>
          If the same canonicalization scheme is used to transform incoming
          requests, before attempting to lookup URLs in the index, then the
          software is able to locate and return the documents correctly.

        <p>
          Currently the Wayback includes only a single reference implementation
          of a canonicalization scheme, which is currently called
          <b>AggressiveUrlCanonicalizer</b>. This implementation provides the

          These heuristics generally lead to correcting many common URL lookup
          problems, but in some cases, these operation do the wrong thing,
          typically by making content which is actually different appear to be
          the same thing.
        
        <p>
          At the IA, we have recently switched to building CDX files using the
          <b>-identity</b> option on the <b>arc-indexer</b> and 
          <b>warc-indexer</b> tools. The <b>-identity</b> option
          <b>requires</b> passing records through the <b>url-client</b>
          tool before sorting and merging into production CDX files. By keeping
          the original &quot;identity&quot; CDX files, we have been able to test various
          URL canonicalization strategies without the overhead of 
          re-processing all the ARC/WARC source materials.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><h3>Future Directions within Wayback<a name="Future_Directions_within_Wayback"></a></h3>
        <p>
          In upcoming wayback releases, we intend to provide more 
          canonicalization implementations, including a configurable 
          implementation that will allow broad customization capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also intend to alter the format of wayback indexes significantly.
          Using this new format will be optional, but once indexes are created
          in the new format is created, other indexes with different
          canonicalization strategies can be built from them without requiring
          a complete reindex of the original ARC/WARC content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new format will also allow a degree of dynamic canonicalization
          at run-time, meaning different strategies can be tested using the
          same indexes, and site-specific canonicalization strategies may be
          possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We anticipate that allowing (advanced) users to easily change between
          canonicalization strategies within the same wayback session will
          promote better community understanding of the impacts of different
          strategies, and will enable the community to build a set of best
          practices for URL canonicalization.

    <div class="section"><h2>Duplicate Reduction<a name="Duplicate_Reduction"></a></h2>
      <p>
        Heritrix 1.12 and above have the capability to write WARC files, which 
        omit storing documents that have not changed since a previous visit. For
        specifics on activating these features, please refer to the Heritrix 
        documentation. When Heritrix is using these features, and notices that
        a document has not changed since the last time it was visited, it 
        creates an abbreviated WARC record, indicating that the document was
        retrieved but not stored. In this abbreviated WARC record is an
        indicator of the SHA1 digest of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wayback uses these identical SHA1 digests to map the location
        (ARC/WARC + offset) of the original record that was stored to subsequent 
        records that were not. When a request for a subsequent capture that was
        not stored is received by wayback, it will return the content of the
        previous stored record.
      </p>
      <p>
        The matching of these digests occurs at query time, and is configured
        by setting the &quot;dedupeRecords&quot; option of the LocalResourceIndex to 
        &quot;true&quot;.
